            When Girard-Perregaux announced its partnership in 2021 with
            legendary British luxury sports car maker Aston Martin, it seemed
            like an obvious and natural pairing. Two iconic marques with rich
            heritages, both of which consistently deliver at the apex of design
            and engineering. Only two years on and the venture has already
            produced four timepieces spanning several GP collections, with all
            but the original brilliantly incorporating the automaker’s
            recognizable Aston Martin Green. While the past three releases have
            built off the historic Laureato models, the newest offering from the
            two brands returns to the roots of the first model they produced,
            the Girard-Perregaux Bridges collection. The new Girard-Perregaux
            Neo Bridges Aston Martin Edition delivers a breathtaking modern
            watch, inspired by the sculptural Aston Martin DB12, and steeped in
            history, craftsmanship, and the combined engineering expertise of
            two luxury brands.

              While the Laureato, Laureato Chronograph, and Laureato Absolute
              Chronograph models made in partnership with Aston Martin have been
              beautiful, modern timepieces, the new Girard-Perregaux Neo Bridges
              Aston Martin Edition manages to strike a balance between
              Girard-Perregaux’s past and its forward-looking present, while
              still effortlessly blending the spirit of Aston Martin’s DB12. As
              the name suggests, the watch puts a contemporary spin on Constant
              Girard’s 1897 design that utilized three parallel bridges and
              infused the architectural dial with striking accents of Aston
              Martin Green, while the sleek silhouette of the cases evokes the
              aerodynamic curves of the DB12.

            For all its storytelling, watchmaking can often be an impersonal
            affair. Among the most glorified timepieces, many are wrapped in
            tales of exploits performed by those we’ll never meet: space
            travelers, adventurers, racing legends, and heroes of wartime
            derring-do. Of the watches outside this intrepid realm, many align
            themselves with poetic contexts, sometimes hyper-specific (sunrise
            over the slopes of Mt. Iwate, anyone?). The remaining watches
            typically draw upon updated archival designs that, while often
            beautiful, lack a certain je ne sais quoi with regard to who was
            actually involved. Sure, a neo-vintage piece is nice. But what else
            makes it special aside from the glassy-eyed nostalgic “remember
            when” sentiments that it triggers?

              The Visionario collection, aside from its familial origins, is
              special for its technical and design cohesiveness. Using an
              uncommon automatic chronograph caliber produced a throw from the
              Arsène Lippens’ headquarters in Neuchâtel, the watches set
              themselves apart at an early stage. Design-wise, they echo the
              sort of styling found on other neo-vintage pieces with
              recognizable qualities like Breguet numerals, paired with unique
              ones such as the automotive-inspired bezel. In another
              personalized touch, the double-step look comes from the similarly
              decorative appearance of the front grill on 1941 Pontiac
              Streamliners. Fortunately, the Visionario’s specs are a bit more
              svelte than the hulking 2.5-ton coupe with a 115” wheelbase.

            After saying goodbye to the UR-210 in 2020 and the UR-220 in 2022,
            Urwerk now welcomes a new model to the popular UR-200 series. Meet
            the Urwerk UR-230 “Eagle” watch, which retains many of the signature
            details of its progenitors but also boasts a slew of updates that
            will no doubt please fans of the independent high-horology watch
            brand.

              Right off the bat, we see the familiarity of the trapeze-shaped
              case; yet, it’s different thanks to its new protective cover that
              can be lifted 90 degrees or locked into place when needed. As is
              customary for Urwerk watches, the UR-230 is sizable, measuring
              44.81mm across, 55mm in length, and 18.38mm thick. Both the case
              and cover are fashioned from Carbon Thin Ply (CTP) carbon and
              black DLC-treated titanium. The black CTP carbon is machined in
              superimposed layers (318 layers in total) and pressure-bonded at
              high temperatures, which yields that distinctive pattern. To
              ensure easy lifting of the cover, the beak-shaped edge includes a
              finger grip; plus, there’s also a brake system to slow it down
              when closing to avoid any damage to the sapphire crystal it serves
              to protect. The case is water resistant to 30 meters.
